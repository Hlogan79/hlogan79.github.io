        <h3>Dark Souls (2011), Dark Souls developed by FromSoftware and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, is a critically acclaimed action role-playing game (ARPG) known for its challenging gameplay, rich lore, and interconnected world design.</h3>
        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        <p><b>Combat:</b> Melee-focused, slow and methodical. Requires stamina management, precise timing, and tactical use of blocking, dodging, and parrying.
        <br>
        <b>Death Mechanics: </b>Upon dying, players drop all collected souls (used for leveling and purchasing). Souls can be recovered if the player reaches the spot of death without dying again.
        <br>
        <b>Bonfires:</b> Serve as checkpoints where players can rest, refill healing flasks, and level upâ€”but enemies (except bosses) respawn.
        <br>  
        <b>Online Elements:</b> Players can leave messages, summon allies, or invade others' games.</p>
            
        <h4>World and Setting</h4>
        <p><b>Lordran:</b> A dark fantasy realm blending Gothic architecture, decaying civilizations, and cosmic horror.
        <br>
        <b>Interconnected World:</b> Lordran is uniquely designed with looping pathways and shortcuts that reward exploration and memory.
        <br>
        <b>No Map:</b> Players must learn geography through experience and landmarks.</p>
            
        <h4>Plot and Lore</h4>
        <p>You are an Undead marked with the Darksign, fated to go hollow (lose humanity and mind).
        <br>
        The world is in decline after the Age of Fire, ushered in by Gwyn, Lord of Cinder, and other powerful beings.
        <br>
        Your quest is to either link the flame and prolong the Age of Fire or let it fade into the Age of Dark, potentially ushering in the rise of humanity.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Dark Souls II (2014), developed by FromSoftware and directed by Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura, is the second entry in the Dark Souls series. It expands on the original formula with new mechanics, areas, and lore while maintaining the challenging, immersive experience.</h3>
        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        <p><b>Combat:</b> Retains the methodical combat of the first game but introduces more weapon options and dual-wielding. The agility stat affects movement and rolling, giving players more control.
        <br>
        <b>Bonfires & Healing:</b> Bonfires serve as checkpoints but with a limited number of uses. Life Gems provide an alternative to the Estus Flask for healing over time.
        <br>
        <b>New Stats:</b> Adaptability governs agility, affecting roll speed and invincibility frames. Human Effigies replace Humanity for restoring human form.</p>
            
        <h4>World and Setting</h4>
        <p><b>Drangleic:</b> The game takes place in the kingdom of Drangleic, a land filled with ruins, forests, castles, and swamps. It's an expansive world with verticality and hidden secrets.
        <br>
        <b>Majula:</b> The peaceful hub area where you return between adventures.
        <br>
        <b>Exploration:</b> Like the first game, exploration is key. The world is interconnected with lots of hidden paths and shortcuts.</p>
        <h4>Plot and Lore</h4>
        <p><b>Bearer of the Curse:</b> You play as an Undead cursed to hollow, searching for a cure in Drangleic.
        <br>
        <b>King Vendrick:</b> The main story revolves around King Vendrick, whose kingdom fell due to the curse. You seek powerful souls, uncovering the history of Drangleic, its rulers, and the world's gradual decay.
        <br>
        <b>Cycles of Fire and Dark:</b> Themes of decline, the cyclical nature of fire, and humanity's struggle with the curse.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Dark Souls III (2016), developed by FromSoftware and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, is the final entry in the Dark Souls series. It refines the combat and systems of previous games, introducing faster, more fluid gameplay and new mechanics like Weapon Arts. With improved visuals and intense boss battles, it brings the saga to a dramatic conclusion, exploring the fading Age of Fire and the cycle of light and dark.</h3>
        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        <p><b>Combat:</b> Dark Souls III builds on the previous games with faster and more fluid combat. It introduces weapon arts, which are special moves tied to each weapon, enhancing combat depth and variety.
        <br>
        <b>Estus Flask:</b> As in the earlier games, the Estus Flask restores health, but now it can be split between healing and magic uses, offering more flexibility.
        <br>
        <b>Ashen Estus Flask:</b> Restores FP (Focus Points), used for magic or special moves.
        <br>
        <b>Refined Stats:</b> The game has an improved pacing, blending elements from the first two games to feel more accessible while maintaining challenge.</p>
    
        <h4>World and Setting</h4>
        <p><b>Lothric:</b> The game takes place in Lothric, a kingdom in decline, where the Age of Fire is fading. The setting includes decaying cities, castles, and twisted landscapes.
        <br>
        <b>Teleportation Focus:</b> Unlike the first two games, the world is less interconnected, with bonfires acting as fast travel points between distinct locations. Firelink Shrine is no longer the central hub for most of the game.
        <br>
        <b>Varied Areas:</b> Areas feel distinct, and the focus is more on teleporting between locations rather than exploring one giant interconnected world.</p>
            
        <h4>Plot and Lore</h4>
        <p><b>The Ashen One:</b> You play as the Ashen One, an undead seeking to either relight the flame or let it die out, depending on your choices.
        <br>
        <b>Lords of Cinder:</b> The goal is to find and confront the Lords of Cinder, powerful beings who once linked the flame but have now either disappeared or become corrupted by their roles.
        <br>
        <b>The End of an Era:</b> The overarching theme is the end of the Age of Fire. The cycle of light and dark is coming to a close, and the game explores the inevitability of this decline and what might come after.</p>
